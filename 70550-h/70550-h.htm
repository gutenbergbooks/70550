<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>“The Miracle of St. Anthony”—whatever
the exact date of its writing, and that
is a point which the author himself has
probably forgotten,—belongs in flavour
and spirit, to that early period of the career
of the Belgian seer and mystic to
which Mr. James Huneker referred when
he wrote “There is no denying the fact
that at one time Maeterlinck meant for
most people a crazy crow, masquerading
in tail feathers plucked from the Swan of
Avon.” For it was to Shakespeare that
he was first compared, though the title
“the Belgian Shakespeare” was applied
ironically by some, just as later manifestations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
of his genius won for him the
appellation of “the Belgian Emerson.”
But “The Miracle of St. Anthony” differs
from the other plays of what may be
called “the early Maeterlinck.” Most of
them, to quote Mr. Edward Thomas, have
a melancholy, a romance of unreality, a
morbidity, combined with innocence, which
piques our indulgence. He has no irony
to put us on the defensive. But irony is
the very essence of “The Miracle of St.
Anthony.” Nor does the scene of the
little play belong to that land of illusion,
that mystic border country, half twilight
and half mirage, in which so many of the
early plays were laid. The St. Anthony
from whom the satire takes its title may
be the blessed St. Anthony of Padua, but
the atmosphere is unmistakably the gray,
sombre Flemish atmosphere that Maeterlinck
knew in his early youth, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Marionettes who speak the lines were
drawn, not from Fairy-land, but from
some town of the Low-Countries.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck’s nationality was not a
mere chance of birth, but a heritage of
many generations. The Flemish family
of which he was born in Ghent on August
29, 1862, had for six centuries been settled
in the neighborhood. His childhood was
passed at Oostacker, in a house on the
bank of a canal connecting Ghent with
Terneuzen. So near was the water that
the ships seemed to be sliding through the
garden itself. The seven years spent at
the Jesuit college of St. Barbe were not
happy years, but there were developed his
first literary aspirations, and there he
formed certain friendships that lasted into
later life. At the University, where he
studied for the Bar, he met Émile Verhaeren,
who was destined to stand out with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
King Albert, Cardinal Mercier, and
Maeterlinck, as one of the great figures of
the land when Belgium came to experience
her agony.</p>

<p>But it was not in Maeterlinck to settle
down to a lawyer’s work and a bourgeois
life. “Like Rodenbach,” said M. Edouard
Schuré, “he had dreamed alongside
the sleeping waters of Belgium and in
the dead cities, and, though his dream did
not become a paralysing reverie, thanks to
his vigorous and healthy body, he was
already troubled in such a way that he was
unlikely to accept the conditions of a legal
career.” So, when at twenty four, he
made his first trip to Paris, though the
visit was professedly in the interests of his
studies, it was with the result that he
plunged definitely and whole heartedly into
literature. To Villiers de l’Isle Adam,
and others of the ultra modern school, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
was introduced by an old <i>copain</i> of the
Jesuit college, Gregoire Le Roy. Le Roy
read to the group Maeterlinck’s “The
Massacre of the Innocents,” a perfectly
Flemish piece of objective realism. It
was applauded, and soon after appeared
in “La Pléïde,” a short-lived review which
also printed some of the poems collected in
“Serres Chaudes.”</p>

<p>That first stay in Paris was one of about
six months. Returning to Ghent, he conformed
to the wishes of his family to the
extent of dabbling a little at the Bar. But
his heart was with “La Jeune Belgique,”
to which he had been introduced by Rodenbach,
author of “Bruges la Morte,” and
for which he was writing his poems. Then
in 1889, when he was twenty-seven years
of age, “Serres Chaudes” was published,
and with it went the last tie binding him to
the law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>Continuing to live in his native Oostacker,
his days were divided between writing,
tending his bees, and outdoor pastimes.
As a member of the Civic Guard of Ghent
he was as poor an amateur soldier as Balzac
had been when enrolled in the National
Guard of the France of his time. His
musket was allowed to rust until the night
before an inspection. Material surroundings
meant little to him. As with Barrie,
the four walls were enough. He could
people the homely room to suit his fancy.
In imagination a table became a mountain
range, a chair the nave of a superb cathedral,
a side-board a limitless expanse of
surging ocean. Through the window he
could look out over a country suggesting
the scene of his early play, “Les Sept
Princesses,” “A dark land of marshes, of
pools, and of oak and pine forests. Between
enormous willows a straight and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
gloomy canal, on which a great ship of war
advances.”</p>

<p>“La Princesse Maleine,” which also appeared
in 1889, had been first privately
printed by the author himself, on a hand
press. With it Maeterlinck was launched
into the fierce light of fame. Octave Mirbeau
wrote of it in the <i>Figaro</i> of Paris.
He said that no one could be more unknown
than the author, but that his book
was a masterpiece, “comparable—shall I
dare say it? superior in beauty to the most
beautiful in Shakespeare.” There were
less generous critics who suggested that the
play was Shakespeare, because it had been
made with scraps of Shakespeare. A
champion of Maeterlinck retorted that in
comparison with Maleine and Hjalmar the
characters of Shakespeare were marionettes.
So the storm raged, to the author’s
infinite disgust. Finally in a spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
modesty and frank acknowledgment he
called the play “Shakespearterie.” There
was no pose in that assumption of
humility. From all testimony he has ever
been the same. Invited to a dinner his
acceptance has been conditional on absolute
simplicity. “After all, I am a peasant.”
It was Gerard Harry who quoted
that. Again, at the end of a first night of
one of his plays, he has been described as
“modest, simple, altogether without display
in dress or manner.” His gestures
were gentle with reflection, his voice low
and rarely heard. He had no pride of success,
but an air at once uneasy and detached,
as if tired of being there. His
deep blue eye was cold and mournful, like
a mirror that retains the images of indefinite
and impalpable things, as Barbey
d’Aurevilly says the eyes always are of
those who look more within than without.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
His brow was deep and square and shone
pale. He made the observer think of his
own untranslatable words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Sous l’eau du songe qui s’élève</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mon âme a peur, mon âme a peur.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same writer says that, by way of
contrast, the playwright keeps bees and
teaches a dog to sing; he calls him a sportsman,
a man always getting about, a great
drinker of ale—a great boy, a Bohemian.
Here also may be discerned the writer in
praise of the sword, the fist, and the automobile,
the friend of the bull-dog and the
creator of Tylo. That was describing the
Maeterlinck of the early days. He seems
never to have greatly changed. Was not
almost the last picture of him that we had
before the outbreak of the Great War one
of poet playing with pugilist at the manly
art of self-defense—the author of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
“L’Oiseau Bleu” sparring and wrestling
daily with the French champion Carpentier?</p>

<p>New influences began to show in Maeterlinck’s
work. His Introduction to his
translation from the Flemish of Ruysbroeck
l’Admirable’s “L’Ornement des
Noces Spirituelles” made public his interest
in Plato, Plotinous, Novalis, Jacob
Behman, and Coleridge. He published a
translation of Novalis’s “Disciples et
Sais.” His feeling for Emerson had become
such that he wrote an Introduction to
the Essays of the American that had been
translated into French by I. Will. To
that period of his career as a playwright
belong “Les Sept Princesses,” the little
plays, “L’Intruse,” and “Les Aveugles,”
“Pélléas et Mélisande,” “Alladine et
Palomides,” “Interieur,” and “La Mort
de Tintagiles.” Then, in 1896, he left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
Oostacker for good, and settled in Paris.
In the same year he published “Le Tresor
des Humbles,” his first volume of Essays,
and “Aglavaine et Selysette.” In a letter
to Madame Maeterlinck he said that
Aglavaine brought him “a new atmosphere,
a will to happiness, a power to
hope.” Henceforth her light will direct
him in a “serene, happy and consoling
course.” Also it was about that time that
his life was joined to the life of Georgette
Leblanc.</p>

<p>In “La Vie Belge,” published in 1905,
Camille Lemonnier told of Maeterlinck’s
first meeting with the talented woman who
was to become his wife. It took place in a
house in the Rue Ducale in Brussels, the
home of Edmond Picard, the great barrister
and patron of Belgian literature.
One midnight, after a performance of
Strindberg’s “Father” at the Théâtre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
du Parc, all were invited there for supper.
Maeterlinck, who still lived in Flanders,
had left his bees, and was there, grave,
silent, dreaming, a little out of his element,
as he always was in the city. He was
truly himself only in the country, his pipe
in his coarse peasant fingers, filling its black
bowl with a fresh pinch of tobacco from
time to time. I had known him at the
house of the painter, Claus, at whose door
he sometimes leaped from his wheel, bare-necked,
muscular, broad of shoulders and
loins, a regular country boy from the village.
This great, silent, contemplative
spirit little knew that he was about to see
appear, under the guise of the charming
Georgette Blanc, the very visage of his
destiny. A great silence spread from the
far end of the hall, and suddenly she entered,
stately and slow, with the jewel of
her <i>ferronière</i> on her forehead, like a sign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
of the empire, in the long swishing of her
train. Picard presented them; she gave a
little cry; and he looked at her, embarrassed,
with his deep-set peasant eyes,
bowing awkwardly, while, with a deep
reverence like a rite, the beautiful actress,
with the ceremonious grace of a little
queen of Byzantium, dedicated to him,
without a word, the homage of her artist’s
worship. Maeterlinck looked at her
a great deal, but scarcely spoke to her during
supper.</p>

<p>But if his tongue was backward, there
were other ways of wooing. “Le Tresor
des Humbles” was dedicated to her.
“La Sagesse et la Destinée” was dedicated
to her, “as the result of her collaboration
in thought and example: he had
only to listen to her words and follow her
life with his eyes when he wrote the book;
for to do so was to follow the words, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
movements, the habits of wisdom itself.”
At any rate the woman understood. Perhaps
she helped matters along a little.
Perhaps her poise served to put the shy
peasant at his ease. It was a wise union,
a union destined for happiness. “Truly,”
said Gerard Harry of it, “henceforward
he looks upon life less desperately and less
fearfully.” The glimpses that Mr. Edward
Thomas gave of the <i>ménage</i> show
Maeterlinck as he was in the last year or
two of world peace, come to fifty years, in
the full vigor of his mature powers, at the
height of his popularity and material success.
Nearly all his books are multiplied
and repeated, by new editions and translations
into many languages. Always independent,
money could only add ease and
opportunities for gratifying minor tastes.
He spends the winter at Quatre Chemins
near Grasse, in the south of France, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
summer at the ancient Benedictine Abbey
of St. Wandrille, in the Department of
Seine-Inferieure. But there is hardly a
moment when Madame Maeterlinck is not
a part of his life and work. She plays
“Macbeth” in her husband’s translation,
while he smokes a pipe of peace as well as
in solitude. The pipe, according to
Gerard Harry, contains a denicotinised
herb; for thus, by a piece of heroism discovered
by his hero-worshipper, Maeterlinck
circumvents his insatiable craving for
tobacco in his working hours. “By wise
disposition,” says Madame Maeterlinck,
“he has reduced his weakness, economised
his strength, balanced his faculties, multiplied
his energies, disciplined his instincts.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” says Mr. Thomas, “he continues
to write. He is early to rise and
go to his garden and his bees, for which
his liking is now near thirty years old.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Two hours, always exactly two hours, of
work follow. Then he goes out again,
canoeing, motoring, cycling, or walking.
He reads in the evening and goes to bed
in good time.” The work of these two
hours is prepared easily and quietly during
the pleasures and other duties of the day.
Madame Maeterlinck compares him taking
up his work to a child leaving its games
and going on with them as soon as allowed—an
innocent and ambiguous comparison.
She implies that his work is sub-consciously
matured and methodically put on
paper, and that his natural tranquillity and
the surroundings and conditions of his life
have long been felicitously combined; and
she says it might seem that the mysterious
powers have woven between him and the
world a veil which allows him a clear
vision whilst yet himself invisible, as they
have favored him by the gift of a home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
not less wonderful than the castles he imagined
for Alladine and Selysette and
Maleine.</p>

<p>However in a consideration of “The
Miracle of St. Anthony,” the life of the
man, his place as a philosopher, and his
achievements as a poet are only indirectly
concerned. The little play counts first of
all in its relation to “La Princesse Maleine,”
“Les Sept Princesses,” and especially,
“Les Aveugles,” and “L’Intruse.”
Perhaps closest to it of them all is “L’Intruse.”
To recall that play. It does not
need the Dutch clock in the corner to fix
the scene in the Lowlands. In a dimly
lighted room in an old country house the
grandfather, the father, the uncle, the
three daughters are sitting about a table.
It has rained the whole week and the
night without is damp and cold. In the
next room lies the sick mother. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
father is hopeful, relying on the assurances
of the doctors. But not the grandfather.
They are expecting some one. They
speak in low voices, at random. Besides
the woman in the other room there is a
young child.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle</span>—The little one would
cause me more anxiety than your wife.
It is now several weeks since he was
born, and he has scarcely stirred. He
has not cried once all the time! He
is like a wax doll.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span>—I think he
will be deaf—dumb, too, perhaps—the
usual result of marriages between
cousins. (<i>A reproving silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father</span>—I could almost wish
him ill for the suffering he has caused
his mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle</span>—Be reasonable. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
not the poor little thing’s fault. He is
quite alone in the room.</p>

</div>

<p>More and more is the old man troubled.
He complains that he can no longer hear
the nightingales, and that some one must
be in the garden. The trees in the park
are trembling as if some one was brushing
a way through, the swans are scared, and
the fishes diving in the pond, but the watch-dog
does not bark. Through the glass
door, that some mysterious agency has
opened, the cold rushes into the room.
The sound of a scythe being sharpened is
heard outside. The child that has before
been silent, begins to cry. There is a
knock at the door. The Father partly
opens it, and speaks to the servant, who
answers, remaining on the outside.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">The Grandfather</span>—Your sister is
at the door?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Uncle</span>—I can see only the
servant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Father</span>—It was only the servant.
(<i>To the servant</i>) Who was that,
that came into the house?</p>

</div>

<p>A note is struck similar to one used later
by Lord Dunsany in “A Night at an Inn.”
Some invisible force is pushing open the
door. The servant protests that it is not
she, as she is standing three yards away
from the door. The Grandfather is conscious
of a new presence. “And who is
that sitting there?” he asks. “But there
is no one there,” he is told. But he will
not believe them, maintaining that in pity
they are deceiving him. A ray of moon-light
penetrates, throwing strange gleams.
The clock strikes midnight; at the last
stroke there is a sound as of some one rising
in haste. Cries of terror from the
child’s room: quick and heavy steps.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
Then silence. The door of the sick
woman’s room slowly opens, and the Sister
of Mercy appears on the threshold. She
bows as she makes the sign of the Cross.</p>

<p>In “Les Aveugles” Maeterlinck turned
from a typically Flemish setting to a forest
on a small island—“a very ancient northern
forest, eternal of aspect, beneath a sky
profoundly starred.” Six old blind men
are on the right, and six old blind women
on the left. They are from a Home for
the Blind and they are in the charge of a
priest—a very old priest, wrapped in a
wide black cloak, and whose eyes, “dumb
and fixed, no longer gaze at the visible side
of eternity, and seem bleeding beneath a
multitude of immemorial sorrows and of
tears.” Fear is in the hearts of the
priest’s charges. They are startled by the
flutter of wings, by the touch of the falling
snow, by the barking of dogs. They understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
nothing save the sound of the sea
and they do not know how near that is.
In the priest’s company they have been exploring
their island, which has “a mountain
that no one has climbed, valleys with
no one to go down to, and caves that have
not been entered to this day.” They know
not yet that the priest is dead, but they are
conscious that something has happened to
him. They offer conjectures, they dig into
the past, they deplore their state. At
length one of the men is led by a dog to
the center, where the body of the priest is.
He touches a face. The others follow and
recognise by feeling the features of their
protector. What are they to do? The
only seeing eyes are those of a child at its
mother’s breast. The child cries at a
noise, and they think that it must be something
and move towards the sound that has
provoked the cry. Their hope is that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
men from the light-house will see them.
At last the footsteps stop. “Who are
you?” asks the child’s mother. But only
silence. “Have pity on us,” cries the
oldest blind woman.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary to the effectiveness
of this piece,” Mr. Thomas has written,
“that we should believe the blind to represent
mankind bewildered after the loss of
religion, their old guide. Whether it is
true or not that religion is dead and men
blind without it, the thought is so stale
that in its nakedness it could be of no
value to any piece of writing. But the
sight of a blind man sitting still or tapping
in the street is always impressive; and to
the blind company in the play are added
many elements of mystery and terror which
enhance this impressiveness. They have
at the start little more humanity than the
rocks and trees among which they sit, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that they are conscious of themselves
and one another. They are like creatures
suddenly made out of the rocks and trees;
and it is easy to picture beings of equal
humanity standing in the depths of a
misty wood when rain falls all through the
day at autumn’s end. Or they are like personifications,
so that we feel no curiosity
with the name of any but that one who
says for Maeterlinck:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We have never seen one another. We
ask one another questions, and we reply;
we live together, we are always together,
but we know not what we are.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was Maeterlinck’s very first play,
“La Princesse Maleine,” that won for him
the dangerous title of “The Belgian
Shakespeare.” Now and then a writer of
our own land has done something that has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
caused limited or injudicious critics to speak
of him as “The American Dickens” or
“The American Thackeray.” As a rule
he has paid a sad price for the unfortunate
comparison. No matter how innocent the
man himself has been, the chorus of mocking,
unthinking laughter has been inevitable.
In the case of Maeterlinck ridicule
was only momentary. The rush of
subsequent achievement was so swift.
The world had had hardly time to gasp at
Octave Mirbeau’s “The Belgian Shakespeare”
before some one else was referring
to Maeterlinck as “The Belgian Emerson.”
But it did not need the acute mind
of a Mirbeau to find the first comparison.
That was obvious. How obvious a few
references to “La Princesse Maleine” will
show. To Maleine herself there is a
flavor of Ophelia. The castle of Marcellos,
her father, king of a part of Holland,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
might be the Castle of Elsinore. There,
when the play opens, is being held the banquet
to celebrate the betrothal of Maleine
and Prince Hjalmar. The watching
guards gossip of the attentions that the
Prince’s father, old Hjalmar, king of another
part of Holland, has been paying to
the exiled Queen Ann of Jutland. A quarrel
between the two kings over the table
leads to war, and in an attack on the castle
most of the defenders are killed and
Maleine disappears. Through a hole in
the wall of the tower in which Maleine
and her nurse are shut up for safety, they
see that the whole land has been laid waste
by war and fire.</p>

<p>In the course of subsequent adventures
Maleine becomes the attendant of Uglyane,
the daughter of the wicked Queen
Ann, whom Hjalmar is now to marry. In
that capacity she carries to her mistress a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
false message saying that Hjalmar is not
going to keep a tryst, and instead goes
herself. Later there is a knocking at a
door, and Maleine enters in the white robes
of a bride. Queen Ann tells old Hjalmar
that he must choose between herself and
the returned Princess, and plans to make
use of a poison, which the physician determines
to make harmless. Then there is
another storm, and Maleine is alone in the
night with a large black dog quivering in a
corner of the room. Old Hjalmar and
Queen Ann come to her door, and pretending
to do her hair, the Queen twists a rope
round Maleine’s neck and strangles her.
The madman, who at Maleine’s previous
appearance, pointing at her, had made the
sign of the cross, thrusts his head in at the
window but is hurled back into the moat
by the king. The murderess puts the
corpse to bed. In the fifth and last act the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
same storm is raging. The castle is struck
by lightning and a mass falls into the moat.
Within all are asking for the king and
Queen Ann. When they enter there are
bloodstains in the king’s white hair.
Maleine’s dead body is discovered, and the
king drags in Ann, proclaiming her guilt
and his own. Hjalmar stabs the murderess
and then kills himself.</p>

<p>In “Les Sept Princesses” there is a vast
hall of marble with seven white marble
steps covered by seven pale silken cushions
on which the seven princesses are sleeping.
The sun is setting, and in its fading light
may be seen a black marshy country and
oak and pine forests. Along the canal
between dark willows, a great warship advances.
On the terrace the old king and
queen and a messenger watch the approaching
vessel. The king’s vision fails him and
it is the queen who describes the full spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of sail touching the willows, and the oars
like a thousand legs. From the ship,
when the anchor drops, the prince descends.
He is shown the seven sleepers,
who are not to be awakened, as the doctor
has forbidden it. “How white they are,
all seven! Oh, how beautiful they are, all
seven! How pale, how strange they are,
all seven! But why are they asleep, all
seven?” says the prince. He indicates his
preference for one of the seven. “That,”
says the queen, “is Ursula, who has waited
seven years for her lover.” The others
are Genevieve, Helen, Cristabel, Madeleine,
Claire, and Claribella. Why was
Marcellus so long in coming? Night and
day they have been watching along the
canal. The sailors turn the ship to a monotonous
song with the burden, “We shall
return no more, we shall return no more.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
The sisters still sleep. The queen is
frightened at the plight of her granddaughters
and sobs against the window,
the watchers seek to enter, but neither door
nor window can be opened. The king and
Marcellus make their way in through a
subterranean passage. All the sleepers
but Ursula awake. “She is not asleep,”
says the queen. “Pour water on her....
Open the door.... It is too late....
Shut! shut!” All cry, shaking the
door, and knocking at the window:
“Open, open!” A black curtain falls.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” says Mr. Thomas, “who
has read ‘Les Aveugles’ and ‘L’Intruse’
could doubt the authorship of ‘Les Sept
Princesses.’ Here are the same agitated,
helpless people speaking in abrupt, simple,
and oft-repeated phrases. Here again,
something is going on which they do not
understand, and are impotent to arrest or
change. But the matter of both earlier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
plays was a not improbable incident which
was developed, it may be extravagantly,
but in a manner that touched human beings.
If ‘Les Aveugles’ was extraordinary,
while ‘L’Intruse’ was not extraordinary in
any way, both were easy to understand.
But ‘Les Sept Princesses’ is a picture
drawn for its own sake. It has its logic,
but the elements in it seem chosen, like
those of ‘La Princesse Maleine,’ because
they are attractive in themselves—the
marble hall and stairs, the terrace, the dark
land of marshes and forests, the canal and
the warship, the seven princesses in white
sleeping on the stairs, the swans, the prince
arriving to claim one of them and finding
her at last dead, the old king and queen
shut outside the hall and knocking vainly
at the windows; only, these elements are
combined without any of the unwieldiness
of ‘La Princesse Maleine,’ without interfering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
with themselves or with anything
else. It is simply a picture in Maeterlinck’s
manner, and this manner has the
effect of creating a feeling of helplessness
and smallness in the presence of fate and
the earth.”</p>

<p>It was not until a later period that
Maeterlinck came under the influence of
the American Emerson. “A Belgian
Emerson,” Mr. James Huneker has said,
“but an Emerson who had in him much of
Edgar Allan Poe.” Surely it was not
through Emerson that Maeterlinck found
the author of “The Raven.” Nor is it
certain that there was any direct inspiration
at all. More likely it is that the same
visions burned early in the brain of the
Flemish mystic that had seethed in the
mind of the gifted, erratic American half a
century before. There was no need for
him to know “The House of Usher” of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the Poe tale. Was there not a House of
Usher perched on every Flemish hill, at
the bottom of every Flemish valley? Was
not the man a forerunner of Maeterlinck
who wrote this?</p>

<p>“Now there are fine tales in the volumes
of the Magi—in the iron-bound melancholy
volumes of the Magi. Therein, I
say, are glorious histories of the heaven
and of the earth, and of the mighty sea—and
of the genius that over-ruled the sea,
and the earth, and the lofty heaven.
There was much lore, too, in the sayings
that were said by the Sybils, and holy, holy
things were heard of old by the dim leaves
which trembled round Dodona, but as
Allah liveth, that fable which the Demon
told me as he sat by my side in the shadow
of the tomb, I hold to be the most wonderful
of all.”</p>

<p>Or this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>“And then did we, the seven, start from
our seats in horror and stand trembling
and aghast, for the tones in the voice of
the shadow were not the tones of any one
being, but of a multitude of beings, and,
varying in their cadences from syllable to
syllable, fell duskily upon our ears in the
well-remembered and familiar accents of
many thousand departed friends.”</p>

<p>The landscape of most of those early
Maeterlinck plays is the landscape of
“Ulalume”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The skies they were ashen and sober,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The leaves they were crisped and sear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was night in the lonesome October</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In my most immemorial year.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was hard by the dim lake of Auber</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the misty mid-region of Weir,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was down by the dark tarn of Auber</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it was a more material setting that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Maeterlinck gave to “The Miracle of St.
Anthony.” Not the intangible Nowhere
or the impalpable At any Time, but the
present day, a commonplace house, and a
small provincial town in the Low Countries.
Instead of stately marble pillars, or
primeval forest, or limitless sea, a room
with leather-covered benches against the
walls, two wooden stoves and an umbrella
stand, on which are hats, a cape and wraps.
Instead of swans and sleeping beauties, the
old drudge Virginie, with her skirts turned
up and her legs bare, swabbing the floor.
In the next room is lying the body of the
Maiden Lady Hortensia, who in her lifetime
had been exceedingly generous in her
donations to the church, and especially
devoted to the memory of the blessed St.
Anthony of Padua. It is the Saint himself,
come to restore her to life as a reward
for her piety, who presents himself at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
door-sill as the curtain rises. In appearance
he is not as the dead woman might
have expected. Bare-headed and bare-footed,
his beard and hair are scrubby and
tangled, and he is clothed in a soiled, sack-like,
and much dirtied cowl. The story
of how he was received by the relatives, the
doctor, the parson, and the gathered guests
may be read by those who turn to the following
pages. It was first presented to
American play-goers by the Washington
Square Players under the direction of Mr.
Edward Goodman at the Bandbox Theatre
in New York, the evening of May 7th,
1915. It had the quality of novelty, for it
was one of the least known of all the plays.
There was a story current at the time that
it was produced from the manuscript.
What Maeterlinck himself thinks of it,
what place in his mind it has in his whole
scheme of literary production, the writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
cannot say. That is a matter as elusive
as the man himself is elusive. To illustrate
that elusiveness by a personal reminiscence:</p>

<p>It was six years ago, in the days when
the world was happy with the blessedness
of a peace that seemed likely to endure, and
when the occasional cloud on the political
horizon was regarded as nothing more
than a mirage, that the writer and a
friend—the latter one of the firm of
M. Maeterlinck’s American publishers—made
a journey to the south of France
for the purpose of paying their respects
to the Belgian mystic in his Nice home.
In London we had been advised by Mr.
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, whose
admirable translations have done so much
to make Maeterlinck’s name a household
name to English-speaking readers.
“Here is his latest letter,” said Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Teixeira. “It is dated from his villa in
the Quartier des Beaumettes, which is the
rising ground at the western end of the
town. You will find him there; that is, if
you succeed in finding him at all. For he
is a very difficult man to find. That is one
of his peculiarities.”</p>

<p>It was the night before the departure
from Nice. Our time was limited. At its
môle in the swarming harbor of Marseilles,
the Sant Anna, which was to carry
us on its roundabout, five thousand mile
journey, with New York as the ultimate
destination, was preparing for its leaving
of the next day. We started on the quest.
At the hotel they could tell us nothing.
The driver of the fiacre engaged was no
better informed. Surprised but undaunted
we were soon winding slowly
between high stone walls, up the beautiful
Beaumettes slope. From villa to villa we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
travelled, to be met everywhere by puzzled,
negative headshakes. “M. Maeterlinck?
We do not know him. We
have never heard of him. We do not
think that he is of the Quartier. Perhaps
if you enquire at the villa beyond you will
learn something.” For two hours in the
darkness sweet scented by the breath of the
semi-tropical plants and flowers, we kept
up the search. But it was in vain. Here
indeed was a prophet unknown in his own
country. What was the reason for the
mystery? Was there a vast conspiracy of
silence and pretended ignorance on the part
of his neighbors? Were solitude and
freedom from interruption so necessary to
his being that the great man had sworn
them to secrecy? Or had he draped himself
in some mysterious veil, some figurative
coat of invisible green, through
which the eyes of those who dwelt in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
Quartier des Beaumettes had never been
able to see? We never found out.
There was about the enigma something
weird, something almost uncanny. We
had been told to seek him in a mansion by
the sea. We could hear the waves of the
Mediterranean beating against the rocks
below. But was it another ocean—an
ocean of the Never, Never Land that had
been meant?</p>

<p>Is there a real Maeterlinck house? we
asked ourselves. Or is his habitation of
such dream stuff as the House of Usher?
Is the land of Maeterlinck a material land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
or is it somewhere “hard by the dim lake
of Auber, in the misty mid-region of Weir:

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to the folding-doors.</i>) She
is laid out in there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>In an astonished voice of delight.</i>)
Yes, but how did you know? It’s wonderful!
She’s there, in the drawing-room....
The poor dear lady! She was only
seventy-seven. That’s no age at all, is it?...
She was a very pious and deserving
lady, you know. She suffered a great
deal.... And she was very rich. They
say she’s left two million francs. That’s
a lot of money.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>It all goes to her two nephews, Monsieur
Gustave and Monsieur Achille. And
she’s left legacies to the Rector, to the
church, to the beadle, to the sacristan, to
the poor, to the Curate, to fourteen Jesuits
and to all the servants, according to
the length of time that they were with her.
I get most. I’ve been in her service for
thirty-three years, so I shall have three
thousand three hundred francs. That’s a
good sum.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>She owed me nothing; she always paid
me my wages regularly. You can say
what you like, you won’t find many mistresses
who would do as much, after they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
were dead and gone. She was one of the
best of women. And we’re burying her
to-day.... Everybody has sent flowers.
You ought to see the drawing-room. It’s
a glorious sight. There are flowers on the
bed, on the table, on the chairs, on the
piano. And nothing but white flowers:
it’s perfectly beautiful. We simply don’t
know where to put the wreaths. (<i>A ring
at the door. She opens it and returns
with two wreaths.</i>) Here are two more.
(<i>Examines the wreaths and weighs them
in her hands.</i>) Aren’t these lovely?
Just hold them a minute till I finish my
work. (<i>She gives the wreaths to <span class="smcap">Saint
Anthony</span>, who takes one in each hand
obligingly.</i>) They’re taking her to the
cemetery this afternoon. Everything has
to be nice and clean; and I’ve only time
to....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Take you to the corpse? Now?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>No, it can’t be done. You must wait a
bit; they are still at lunch.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>God bids me hurry; there is no time
to lose.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>What do you want with her?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I’ve told you: I want to bring her back
to life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>You want to bring her back to life? Seriously,
do you want to raise her from the
dead?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>But she’s been dead three days.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>That’s why I wish to raise her from the
dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>For her to live again as before?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>But then there won’t be any heirs?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>But what will Monsieur Gustave say?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I don’t know.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>And will she take back the three thousand
three hundred francs which she gave
me because she was dead?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes, of course.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>That’s a nuisance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Have you no other money, no savings?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Not a farthing. I have an invalid sister
who takes every penny I earn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Well, if you are afraid of losing your
three thousand francs....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Three thousand three hundred
francs....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>If you’re afraid of losing the money,
then I won’t raise her from the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Couldn’t I keep the money and you
bring her back to life just the same?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No, you must take it or leave it. I
came down in answer to your prayers:
it’s for you to choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>After a moment’s reflection.</i>) Well,
then, bring her back to life all the same.
(<i>The <span class="smcap">Saint’s</span> halo lights up and shines.</i>)
What’s the matter with you now?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>You have pleased me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>And then does that lantern thing light
up?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes, of itself.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>That’s funny.... But don’t stand so
near the lace curtains, or you’ll set them
on fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>There’s no danger: it’s celestial flame....
Take me to the body.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>I’ve told you: you must wait. I can’t
disturb them now. They’re still at lunch.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Why, my masters, of course! The
whole family! First her two nephews,
Monsieur Gustave and Monsieur Achille,
with their wives and children, Monsieur
Georges, Monsieur Alberic, Monsieur
Alphonse and Monsieur Désiré....
And cousins, male and female, and the
Rector and the Doctor and I don’t know
who besides: friends and relatives from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
distance, whom I’d never seen. They’re
very rich people.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Did you notice the street?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>What street?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Why, ours, of course! The one in
which our house stands.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>It’s a handsome street. Well, all the
houses on the left-hand side of the street,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
except the little one at the end, the baker’s
shop, belong to Mademoiselle Hortense.
Those on the right-hand side are Monsieur
Gustave’s. There are twenty
houses. That means money.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to the halo.</i>) Look, your
lantern thing is going out.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Feeling his halo.</i>) Yes, I’m
afraid....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t it keep burning very long?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>It all depends upon the thoughts that
feed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Yes, they own woods ... and farms
... and houses galore! Monsieur Gustave
has a starch-factory: Gustave’s
Starch, you’ve heard of it, I expect! Oh,
they’re an amazingly well-off family.
There are four of them who live on their
incomes and do no business at all. That’s
splendid, that is!... And such friends
and acquaintances and tenants!...
Well, they’ve all come to the funeral, some
of them from ever so far. There’s one,
I’m told, who travelled two days and two
nights to get here in time. I’ll show him
to you: he has a lovely beard....
They’re lunching here. They haven’t
finished yet. We can’t disturb them.
It’s a great lunch: there are twenty-four
of them sitting down to it. And I’ve seen
the bill of fare: there’s oysters, two soups,
three entrées, crayfish in jelly, and trout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
<i>à la Schubert</i>. Do you know what that
is?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>No more do I. They say it’s very
good; but it’s not for you and me.
There’s no champagne, because of the
mourning; but there’s every other kind
of wine. Mademoiselle Hortense had
the best cellar in the town. I’ll try and
get you a good big glass, if they leave any;
then you’ll see the sort of thing....
Wait, I’ll go and look what they’re doing.
(<i>She goes up the steps, draws back the
curtains and peeps through the glass door
on the left.</i>) I think they’re beginning
the trout, the trout <i>à la Schubert</i>. Oh,
there’s Joseph moving the pine-apple.
They’ve a good two hours before them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
You’d better take a seat. (<i><span class="smcap">Saint
Anthony</span> goes to the leather-covered
bench and is about to sit down.</i>) No, no,
not there, you’re much too dirty! Sit on
the stool. I must get on with my work.
(<i><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span> sits down on a stool;
<span class="smcap">Virginie</span> resumes her work and takes up
a pail of water.</i>) Look out! Lift up
your feet; I’m going to splash the water....
No, don’t stay there; you’re in my
way; and it’s not cleaned yet.... Go
over there in the corner; push the stool
against the wall. (<i><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>
obediently does as she tells him.</i>) There,
now you won’t get your feet wet. Aren’t
you hungry?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No, thank you, but I’m rather in a
hurry; so go and tell your masters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>You’re in a hurry? What have you got
to do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Two or three miracles.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>I can’t tell them anything while they’re
at lunch. We must wait till they’ve had
their coffee. Monsieur Gustave might be
very angry.... I don’t know what sort
of reception he’ll give you; he doesn’t like
having poor people in the house. You
don’t look over-prosperous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No, saints are never prosperous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>They have money given them, though.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes, but not everything that’s given to
the saints reaches heaven.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean it? Then do the
priests take what we give? I’ve heard
it said; but I wouldn’t believe.... There
now, I’ve got no water left!... I say!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Do you see a brass tap on your right?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>There’s an empty pail beside it.
Would you mind filling it for me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>With pleasure.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>You see, I’ll never get all this cleaning
done if some one doesn’t help me. And
there’s nobody to help me: they’re all
losing their heads.... It’s a terrible
job, a death in the house! You know that
as well as I do. A good thing it doesn’t
happen every day.... Monsieur Gustave
will make a fuss if everything isn’t
clean and shining when his guests come
through here.... He’s not easy to
please.... And I still have all the brass
to do.... There, turn the tap; that’s
right.... Bring me the pail....
Aren’t your feet cold? Tuck up your
gown or it’ll get wet.... Mind the
wreaths; put them on the stool....
That’s right, that’s capital. (<i><span class="smcap">Saint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
Anthony</span> brings her the pail</i>.) Thanks,
you’re very kind.... I want one more.
(<i>A sound of voices and of chairs being
pushed back.</i>) Listen! What’s that?
I’ll go and see. (<i>She goes to the glass
door.</i>) Hallo, the master has got up!
What can it be? Have they quarrelled?...
No, the others are eating....
Joseph is filling up the Rector’s glass....
They are finishing the trout....
The master is coming to the door....
Why, I might speak to him as he comes
out and tell him that you....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes, do, please; tell him at once.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Very well. Put down the pail; I don’t
want it. Here, take this broom. Not
like that! You’d better sit down again.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
(<i><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span> obeys and sits on the
two wreaths lying on the stool.</i>) Hi,
what are you doing? You’re sitting on
the wreaths!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I beg your pardon. I’m a little short-sighted.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Clumsy! They’re a pretty sight now!
And what Monsieur Gustave will say when
he sees those two wreaths!... Thank
goodness, they’re not so bad after all!
We can put them right. Sit down over
there; take them on your knees; and keep
quite quiet. (<i>She goes down on her knees
before the <span class="smcap">Saint</span>.</i>) I have a favour to
ask you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Speak, don’t be afraid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Give me your blessing, while we are by
ourselves. When the company comes out,
I shall be sent away; and I sha’n’t see you
any more. Give me your blessing for myself
alone. I am old and need it badly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Rises and blesses her. His halo lights
up.</i>) I bless you, my daughter, for you
are good, simple of heart and mind, faultless,
fearless, guileless in the presence of
the great mysteries and faithful in the
performance of your little duties. Go in
peace, my child. Go and tell your
masters....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I have come to raise her from the
dead....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>But you understand, surely, that this is
not the moment.... The partridges are
getting cold, the guests are waiting. Besides
we are not in the mood for laughing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>Appears at the top of the steps, napkin
in hand.</i>) What’s the matter, Gustave?
What’s up? We’re waiting for the
partridges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Our friend here refuses to go away.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Is he boozed?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Well, of course.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Kick him out and have done with it. I
don’t see why our good luncheon should
be spoilt for the sake of a dirty drunkard.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>He won’t go.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>What’s that? Won’t go? We’ll soon
see about that!...</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>All right, you try.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>I’m not going to tackle a dirty tramp
like him. But there’s Joseph, there’s the
coachman.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>We have tried; it’s no use; and, short
of employing absolute violence....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Guest</span></p>

<p>What’s it all about?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Another</span></p>

<p>What are you doing, Gustave?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Another</span></p>

<p>What does the fellow want?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Another</span></p>

<p>Where has he sprung from?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>He won’t go away. It’s another of
Virginie’s blunders. As soon as she
catches sight of a beggar, she loses her
head. It’s really too silly. She let this
madman in; and he insists on seeing Aunt
Hortense and raising her from the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Guest</span></p>

<p>You should send for the police. Why
don’t you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>No, no; no scandal! I don’t want the
police in the house on a day like this.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>Changing his tone.</i>) Gustave.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Have you noticed that two or three of
the flags are cracked, over there on the
left, at the end of the hall?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Yes, I know. It doesn’t matter; I’m
going to have a mosaic floor to take the
place of the flags.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>That’ll look more cheerful....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>And, better still, more modern. Instead
of that door, with the lace curtains,
I thought of having a painted window
illustrating Hunting, Industry and
Progress, with a garland of fruit
and game.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Yes, that will be very nice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>As for my office, I intend to have it in
there (<i>pointing to the folding-doors</i>), with
the clerks’ office opposite.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>When shall you move in?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>A few days after the funeral. It would
not do to come in the very next day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>No. But meanwhile we must get rid
of this chap.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>He’s made himself quite at home.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>To <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>) Won’t you
have a chair?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Naïvely.</i>) No, thank you. I’m not
tired.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Leave him to me. I’ll soon dispose of
him. (<i>Approaching the <span class="smcap">Saint</span>, in a
friendly tone.</i>) Come, my friend, tell us
who you are.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I am Saint Anthony.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, you’re right. (<i>To the
others.</i>) He sticks to it, but he’s quite
harmless. (<i>Noticing the <span class="smcap">Rector</span> among
the <span class="smcap">Guests</span> who have crowded around
<span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span> and giving him an artful

Rector; he knows you, and wants to pay
you his respects. Saints are your business,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Father: I know more about ploughs and
traction-engines. Here’s an emissary
from heaven, Father, great Saint Anthony
in person, who would like a word with
you. (<i>Under his breath to the <span class="smcap">Rector</span>.</i>)
We want to get him quietly to the door,
without letting him know. Once he is outside,
good-bye.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rector</span></p>

<p>(<i>In an unctuously paternal tone.</i>)
Great Saint Anthony, your humble servant
bids you welcome to this world, which you
have deigned to honour with your celestial
presence. What does your Holiness
wish?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>To raise Mademoiselle Hortense from
the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rector</span></p>

<p>It’s true that she’s dead, poor lady!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Well, the miracle should present no
difficulty to the greatest of our saints.
The dear departed had a particular devotion
to you. I will take you to her, if
your Holiness will be good enough to
come with me. (<i>He goes to the street-door
and beckons to <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>)
This way, please.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to the folding-doors.</i>) No,
that way, in there....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rector</span></p>

<p>(<i>Still more unctuously.</i>) Your Holiness
will pardon me if I venture to contradict
you, but the corpse, because of the
influx of visitors, has been removed to the
house opposite, which, I may mention, also
belonged to the dear departed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Pointing to the folding-doors.</i>) She
is in there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rector</span></p>

<p>(<i>More and more unctuously.</i>) Let me
beg your Holiness, in order to convince
yourself to the contrary, to accompany me
for a moment into the street, where you
will see the candles and the black hangings....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Imperturbably, still pointing to the
folding-doors.</i>) That is where I shall
go.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Guest</span></p>

<p>Did you ever hear any one like him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>He’s going a trifle too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Guest</span></p>

<p>Let us open the door and all of us push
him out together.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>No, no; no scene! He might lose his
temper. He’s very dangerous; he’s
enormously strong. Keep your hands
off him. Joseph and I, who are no weaklings,
either of us, couldn’t make him move
an inch. It’s funny, but he seems rooted
to the soil.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>But who told him that the corpse was in
there?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Virginie, of course; she’s been babbling
for all she’s worth.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Me, sir? Excuse me, sir, not me; I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
attending to my work. I answered yes
and no, nothing else.... Didn’t I, Saint
Anthony? (<i>The <span class="smcap">Saint</span> makes no reply.</i>)
Well, can’t you answer when you’re asked
a civil question?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>She did not tell me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>There, you see! He’s a saint; he knew
it all beforehand. I tell you, there’s nothing
he doesn’t know.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>Going to the <span class="smcap">Saint</span> and tapping him
amicably on the shoulder.</i>) Now then,
my fine fellow, come on; put your best foot
forward, what!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Guests</span></p>

<p>Will he go, or won’t he?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>I have an idea.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>What’s that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Where’s the doctor?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Guest</span></p>

<p>He’s still at table; he’s finishing up the
trout....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>(<i>To <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>.</i>) Go and fetch him.
(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Joseph</span>.</i>) You’re right, he’s a
madman; it’s the doctor’s business.
(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> and the <span class="smcap">Doctor</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>(<i>Appears with his mouth full and his
napkin tucked under his chin.</i>) What’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
up? Is he mad? Is he ill? Is he
drunk? (<i>Looking the <span class="smcap">Saint</span> over.</i>)
Why, it’s a beggar! I’m of no use in
his case. Well, my friend, are things
going badly? Is there something we
want?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I want to raise Mademoiselle Hortense
from the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>Ah, I see you’re not a medical man!
May I have your hand? (<i>Feels the
<span class="smcap">Saint’s</span> pulse.</i>) Any pain?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>(<i>Feeling his head and forehead.</i>)
And here? Does it hurt when I press my
finger?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>Excellent, excellent! Do you ever feel
giddy?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>And in the past ... no accident, at
any time? Let’s have a look at your
chest. Say “Ah!” That’s right. Once
more; deep breath. Deeper, deeper.
That’s right.... And what is it you
want, my man?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>To go into that room.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>To raise Mademoiselle Hortense from
the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>She’s not there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>She is there. I see her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>He sticks to it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Couldn’t you give him a hypodermic injection?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>What for?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>To send him to sleep. Then we would
put him in the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>No, no; no nonsense. Besides, it’s
dangerous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>That’s his look out, not ours. We’re
not paid to take care of madmen, tramps
or drunkards.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>Shall I give you my opinion?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>I wish you would.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>We have to do with a madman, a rather
feeble-minded and quite harmless monomaniac,
who may become dangerous, however,
if we thwart him. I know the type....
We are among ourselves; moreover,
strange though the experiment which he
proposes may seem, it involves no lack of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
respect for the dear departed.... That
being so, I don’t see why, in order to
avoid any scandal and since he’s asking
such a simple thing, we shouldn’t allow him
to go into the room for a moment.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Never! What’s the world coming to,
if the first person that comes along can
force his way like this into a respectable
household, under the ridiculous pretext of
bringing back to life a dead woman who
has never done him any harm?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>As you please; it’s for you to decide.
On the one hand, you have an inevitable
scandal, for nothing will make him give
up his idea; on the other, a small concession
which costs you nothing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>The doctor’s right....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing to be afraid of. I’ll
take the whole responsibility. Besides, we
shall all be there and we shall go in with
him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Very well, then, let’s have done with it....
But, whatever happens, don’t let this
ludicrous incident get about, will you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Aunt Hortense’s jewels are put out on
the mantelpiece....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>I know. I’ll keep an eye on them, for
I confess that I don’t trust him. (<i>To
<span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>) It’s this way, come
in. But be quick about it; we haven’t
lunched yet.</p>

sacred feelings; and I ask you once more,
for the last time....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Allow me, please! (<i>He goes nearer
the bed and raises his voice more authoritatively.</i>)
Arise!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>(<i>Losing his patience.</i>) That’s enough!
We’ll end by quarrelling.... Come, this
way: the door’s over here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You can’t take it seriously. She’ll have
a relapse.</p>

<p>No, no, I assure you. Just see how

coming to? Where are the laws of
nature? Doctor, what do you say?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>(<i>Embarrassed.</i>) What do I say?
What would you have me say? It doesn’t
concern me, it’s not my business. It’s
absurd and, at the same time, quite simple.
If she’s alive, then she was never dead.
There’s no reason to be amazed and proclaim
a miracle.</p>

doubts, but I would not tell you of them,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Léontine</span></p>

<p>And me, auntie? I am your old niece
Léontine.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Valentine</span></p>

<p>And me, my dear godmother, do you
know me? I am little Valentine, to whom
you left all your silver.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>She’s smiling.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Not at all, she looks displeased.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>But she recognizes us all.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>Seeing <span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Hortense</span>

She’s going to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Heavenly Father!... And she has
seen God!... She’ll tell us about the
delights of Paradise!... On your knees!
On your knees!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Listen! Listen!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mademoiselle Hortense</span></p>

<p>(<i>Eyeing <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span> with scorn
and disgust. In a shrill and angry voice.</i>)
Who is this person? Who has dared to
let a bare-footed tramp into my drawing-room?
He’s dirtied all the carpets as it
is!... Put him out at once!... Virginie,
how often have I told you not to let
beggars....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Raising his hand imperiously.</i>) Silence!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<div class="direction">

<p>(<i>The <span class="smcap">Aunt</span> stops suddenly in the

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You must forgive her, she does not yet
know how much she owes you. But we,
we know. There’s no question but that
what you have done was more than most
people could have done. It may have
been an accident or ... something else;
upon my word, I don’t know. But what
I do know is that I am proud and happy
to shake you by the hand.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I should like to go, please. I have
work to do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t be in such a hurry! We
can’t let you go like this. You shall not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
leave empty-handed. I don’t know what
my aunt will give you: that’s her affair: I
cannot promise anything in her name.
But, for my part, I will consult my brother-in-law;
and, whether it be a coincidence or
... something else, we will pay for the
coincidence without quibbling about the
amount; and you shall have no reason to
regret what you have done. That’s so,
Achille, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Certainly, you will not regret it, on the
contrary.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>We are not tremendously well off; we
have wives and children and we have had
our disappointments; but, after all, we
know how to recognize a kindness; and, if
it were only for the honour of the family,
it would never do to have it said that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
stranger, however poor, came and did us
a service without receiving a reward, a
decent reward, the best reward that in us
lies, a reward in proportion to our means,
which, I repeat, are limited.... Oh, I
know, there are services which nothing
can repay and which are not paid for: you
need not tell me that! I know it, I know
it: don’t interrupt me. But that’s no
reason why we should not do something....
Come, what do you think we owe
you? Name your own figure. Of course,
you must not ask for anything excessive;
we couldn’t give it you; but whatever
seems reasonable you shall have.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>My brother-in-law is right: but, while
the matter is arranging, I propose to make
a little collection among ourselves. That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
won’t prejudice you in any way and will
keep you going for a time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I want to go away, please. I have
other work to do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Other work to do! Other work to do!
What work can you have to do?...
No, I can’t have that; and it’s not nice of
you to suggest it. What would people say
if they heard that we let you go like this
after restoring the dear departed to us?
If you won’t take money—and I understand
your delicacy of feeling and approve
of it—at least you will do us the pleasure
of accepting a little keepsake? Oh, don’t
be afraid: just a trifle, a cigar-holder, or
a tie-pin, or a meerschaum pipe. I could
have your name and address and the date
engraved on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No, thank you. I can accept nothing.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Do you mean that?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>(<i>Taking out his cigar-case.</i>) At any
rate, you will do us the pleasure of smoking
a cigar with us. You can’t refuse that.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Thank you, I do not smoke.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You’re most discouraging. Still, what
would you like? You must have a wish
of some sort. You have only to speak,
for everything is yours in this house, which
you have filled with gladness. It’s all
yours. I can’t say more than that. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
least, all that one can honestly part with....
Why, it’s an insult to leave us like
this!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Look here, I have an idea that’s not
half bad. As our friend won’t accept anything—and,
like my brother-in-law, I
understand his delicacy, of which, I am
sure, we all approve; for life can’t be paid
for and has no price—well, since he has
shown a disinterested nature which at once
makes him our equal, what I want to know
is this: why should he not do us the honour
of sitting down with us and helping us
finish a luncheon which he has so happily
interrupted!... What do you all say?...
(<i>Murmurs of restrained approval.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>That’s it! The very thing! That
settles everything! How clever of you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
to think of it!... (<i>To <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>)
Well, what do you say?...
By squeezing a bit, we can easily make
room for you. You shall have the seat
of honour. The partridges will be cold,
but no matter: you have a good appetite,
I feel sure!... Well, that’s arranged,
eh? There will be no ceremony: we’re
decent people and easy-going, as you
see....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No, really. You must excuse me. I’m
sorry, I can’t. I’m expected elsewhere.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Oh, come, you can’t refuse us this!
Besides, who’s expecting you?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Another corpse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>A corpse! Another corpse! It won’t
run away! Surely you’re not going to put
a corpse before us! To throw us over
for a corpse!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>No, I see what it is. You would rather
go down to the kitchen, wouldn’t you?
You’d feel more comfortable there.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Then he can come up afterwards for
coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Ah, he’s not refusing! He prefers
that! I understand. Virginie, leave your
mistress—she doesn’t need you now—and
take the gentleman down to your
kitchen. Give him some of everything.
(<i>He taps the <span class="smcap">Saint</span> familiarly on the
stomach.</i>) Ha, ha! You and Virginie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
are going to have a jolly good time
together! I guessed right, didn’t I, you
old rogue you! You old sly-boots!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>In a voice of alarm.</i>) Sir!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>I don’t know, but Mademoiselle Hortense
has lost her speech again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>What? She’s lost her speech?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir, look.... She’s opening her
mouth and moving her lips and working
her hands but her voice has gone.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>What is it, aunt? Is there something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
you want to tell us? (<i>She nods assent.</i>)
And you can’t? There, there, make an
effort; it’s a temporary paralysis, that’s
all. It will soon pass. (<i>She makes a
sign that she can no longer speak.</i>)
What’s the matter with you? What do
want? (<i>To <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>) What’s
the meaning of this?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>She will never speak again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>She will never speak again? But she
has been speaking. You heard her. She
even gave you a piece of her mind.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>It was an oversight on my part. She
won’t have her voice again.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Can’t you restore it to her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>And when will it come back?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Never.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>What! Will she remain dumb to the
end of her days?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>She has beheld mysteries which she may
not reveal.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Mysteries? What mysteries?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>The mysteries of the dead.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>The mysteries of the dead? This is
a fresh joke. What do you take us for?
No, no, my lad, this won’t do! She
spoke; we all heard her; we have witnesses.
You have, of malice prepense,
deprived her of her power of speech, with
an object which I am beginning to see
through. You’ll just restore it at once,
or....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>It was really not worth while bringing
her back to life, to give her to us in this
condition.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>If you could not give her back to us as
she was before your stupid and clumsy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
interference, you would have done better
not to have meddled.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>It was a bad action.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>An abuse of confidence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>An abuse of confidence: that’s what it
was. There is no excuse for it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You’re expecting to blackmail us, perhaps?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>I suppose you think you’re dealing with
a pack of fools?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Who asked you to come? I hate saying
it, but I would rather see her dead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
than have her back in this state. It’s
too cruel, too painful for those who love
her. You can’t come like this, under the
pretence of working a miracle, and disturb
the peace of the people who have done you
no harm, bringing unhappiness upon them!
A nice thing. But he laughs best who
laughs last!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>Allow me. Calm yourselves. The
man has done wrong, there’s no doubt of
that; but we must not blame him: he is
probably unaccountable for his actions.
(<i>Going up to <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>) Just let
me examine your eyes, my friend. That’s
it: I knew it! I would not interfere while
everybody was thanking him, much too
cordially, for the miraculous resurrection
which he had wrought. I did not wish to
appear to meddle with what does not concern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
me. I knew what was what; and
you see, as I do, that she was not dead at
all. There is nothing supernatural or
mysterious about all this. It simply means
that the fellow possesses rather unusual
hypnotic powers; and he has abused them,
in order to indulge in a hoax which may
be self-interested and which, in any case,
is out of place. He came at the right
moment, that is all; and it is highly
probable that, had he not been here, you
and I would have worked the miracle, if
miracle there be.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Well, what are we to do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>Why, prevent him from doing further
mischief by having him locked up! The
man’s dangerous!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You’re right; we must put a stop to this;
besides, I’ve had enough of it....
Joseph!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Joseph</span></p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Run to the police-station at the corner;
fetch two policemen; tell them to bring a
pair of handcuffs with them. He’s a dangerous
fellow and capable of everything,
as he has shown us only too plainly.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Joseph</span></p>

<p>Very well, sir. (<i>He runs out.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I beg leave to withdraw.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>That’s right, old chap, play the innocent.
It’s time you did. Yes, you can withdraw;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>

<p>Saint what? Saint Anthony? That’s

<p>(<i>Very gently.</i>) I have no other.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>Keep a civil tongue in your head, will

<p>It’s in Italy.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>I know, I know. I wanted to make him
say it. So you’re an Italian. I thought
as much. Where did you last come from?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>From Paradise.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>What Paradise? Where is that land
of malefactors?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>It is the place to which the souls of those
who have died in the Lord ascend after
their death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>I see, I see, I understand! You’re
coming the artful over me! You’re pulling
my leg! First you’re impudent and
now you’re being clever! Very well, your
case is quite clear: we’ll soon settle it....
(<i>To <span class="smcap">Gustave</span>.</i>) Let’s hear what he has
done. What has he stolen?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>I can’t yet say for certain that he has
stolen anything; I haven’t had time to take
stock of things; and I don’t like to accuse
him without being sure. We must be just
before all things. But he has done something
more serious.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>I never doubted it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You know the loss which we have
suffered. While we were mourning the
dear departed and finishing our lunch, he
made his way into the house under some
pretext or other, with intentions which you
can easily guess. He took advantage of
the maid’s simplicity and credulousness to
have the door opened of the room where
the body was laid out. He obviously
hoped to turn our disorder and grief to
account in order to fish in troubled waters
and make a haul. He may have learnt
through an accomplice that our aunt’s
jewels and silver were put out on the
mantelpiece. Unfortunately for him, our
aunt was not dead. And, suddenly, seeing
this repellent figure in her room, she woke
up, cried out and spoke to him roundly
and pluckily. Then, to take revenge for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
his discomfiture, I don’t know how—the
doctor will explain—he deprived her of
the use of her speech; and, notwithstanding
our entreaties, he refuses to restore it to
her, naturally hoping to make us pay
through the nose. Mind you, I am making
no accusations; I am simply stating the
facts. As for the rest, you can ask the
doctor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>I will furnish all the necessary explanations
before the Commissary; if he wishes
it, I will draw up a report.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, there’s no mistake about it:
he’s either a criminal or a madman, perhaps
both. In any case, he’s a dangerous
person who must absolutely be locked up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>That’s quite clear. We’ll get rid of
him for you. (<i>To the <span class="smcap">Policeman</span>.</i>)
Rabutteau!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Policeman</span></p>

<p>Yes, Sergeant.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>The handcuffs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Sergeant, it was very good of you and
your mate to come round. Before leaving
us, you must do us the pleasure of taking
a glass of something with us.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>We won’t say no to that, eh, Rabutteau?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
Especially as the prisoner looks like a
tough customer.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Joseph, bring a bottle and some glasses.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Policeman</span></p>

<p>You can’t tell if it’s raining or snowing,
but it’s worse than either.</p>

<p>(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Joseph</span> with a tray filled with
glasses, which he hands round.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

your very good health!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>(<i>Touching glasses with the <span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>.</i>)
Sergeant, your health! (<i>They all touch
glasses with the <span class="smcap">Sergeant</span>.</i>) Have another?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>I don’t mind. (<i>Smacking his lips.</i>)
That’s good wine, that is!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I’m thirsty. I should like a glass of
water.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>(<i>Grinning.</i>) A glass of water! D’ye
hear him? You shall have some water,
my lad; you wait till we’re outside; it’ll
come pouring into your mouth....
Come, we’ve hung around long enough....
Rabutteau, the handcuffs; and you,
put out your hands....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>But I haven’t....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Sergeant</span></p>

<p>What! Resistance and protests!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
That’s the last straw! They’re all alike!
(<i>A ring at the front-door.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>A ring at the bell! (<i><span class="smcap">Joseph</span> goes
to the front-door.</i>) What’s the time?
Perhaps it’s the first guests.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Hardly. It’s not three yet. (<i>Enter
the <span class="smcap">Commissary of Police</span>.</i>) Hallo, it’s
Monsieur Mitrou, the Commissary of
Police!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span></p>

<p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I heard... (<i>Catching sight of <span class="smcap">Saint
Anthony</span>.</i>) Why, I thought as much:
it’s Saint Anthony himself, the great Saint
Anthony of Padua!...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>You know him, then?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Commissary</span></p>

<p>Know him? I should think I did know
him! It’s the third time that he’s escaped....
You know, he’s a little.... (<i>He
taps his forehead with his finger.</i>) And
at each escape he does the same tricks: he
cures the sick, heals cripples, practises
medicine without a license—in short,
commits a number of illegal actions....
(<i>Goes up to <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span> and examines
him more attentively.</i>) Yes, it’s
he.... Or at least.... But he has
changed a good deal since his last
escapade.... Anyway, if it’s not he, it
must be his brother.... There’s something
that’s not quite clear to me. We’ll
look into it at the police-station. Come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
along, I’m in a hurry; come along, lads,
quick, to the station, to the station!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Better let him out this way, through the
garden; it’ll attract less notice. (<i><span class="smcap">Joseph</span>
opens the garden door, admitting a whirl
of rain, sleet and wind.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>Brrr, what weather! It’s raining,
snowing, hailing! (<i>They push <span class="smcap">Saint
Anthony</span> to the door.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>Running up.</i>) But, sir, the poor
man!... Look, he’s bare-footed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>Well, what of it? Do you want us to
send for a carriage? Or a shrine, perhaps?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>No, I’ll lend him my sabots. Take
them, Saint Anthony; I have another pair.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Putting on the sabots.</i>) Thank you.
(<i>His halo lights up.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>And are you putting nothing on your
head? You’ll catch cold.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>I haven’t anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>Take my little shawl. I’ll run and fetch
you my umbrella. (<i>She hurries out.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>The old fool.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>This is all very well, but meanwhile
we’re standing in the devil of a draught....
Come, take him to the station and
let’s have an end of this.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>(<i>Returning with an enormous umbrella,
which she offers to <span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>.</i>)
Here’s my umbrella.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span></p>

<p>(<i>Showing his hands.</i>) They’ve fastened
my hands.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Virginie</span></p>

<p>I’ll hold it for you. (<i>Standing on the
threshold, she opens the umbrella to shelter
<span class="smcap">Saint Anthony</span>, who goes out between
the two <span class="smcap">Policemen</span>, followed by the <span class="smcap">Commissary</span>.
The <span class="smcap">Saint’s</span> halo shines under
the umbrella; and the group moves away
over the snow in the garden.</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>(<i>Closing the door.</i>) At last!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>A good riddance to bad rubbish!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Achille</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter with her? She’s
sinking, she’s falling back on the bed!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

<p>(<i>Hurrying forward.</i>) I don’t know....
I’m afraid....</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

<p>(<i>Leaning over the bed.</i>) Aunt, aunt!...
Well?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Doctor</span></p>

you so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Gustave</span></p>

nothing to be done?</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
